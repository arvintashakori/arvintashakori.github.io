        As a dedicated problem-solver with a track record of delivering results in complex projects, I'm recognized for my adaptability and have earned the trust of senior leadership, leading to my involvement in significant projects and fostering a culture of collaboration.
      <text class="text-lg">
        I'm a Senior Software and Machine Learning Engineer, Tech Lead at Texavie, an award-winning startup in intelligent clothing, and a last-year Ph.D. candidate at UBC. With over a decade of experience, both in industry and academia, I've led teams, strategized, and managed and scaled up innovative and cutting-edge software solutions.
      <text class="text-lg">
        My expertise covers Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs), Generative AI, Secure and Trustworthy AI, Web3, Software/Firmware/Hardware Development, Wearables, Edge Computing, Consumer Electronics, and Internet of Things (IoT), especially in digital health.
      <text class="text-lg">
        I'm skilled in Generative AI models, Signal Processing, Game Theory, NLP, Federated Learning, Web3, Convex Optimization, and software technologies like Full-Stack Development, Mobile Development, and Cloud Services, alongside FPGA/ASIC/Firmware Development and Hardware Design.
      <text class="text-lg">
        I did my MSc. in Electrical and Computer Engineering, my B.Sc.s (Double degree) in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science all from Sharif University of Technology (Ranked 1st in Iran). My doctoral thesis explores Human-Computer Interaction, focusing on Secure, Fair, and Robust Hand Object Interaction Understanding using Wearable Sensing Textile. Currently, I'm advancing the frontier of Hand Pose Estimation using Wearable Sensing Textiles. Let's innovate together.
